This Homework contains 15 API Tests.

For running these you need to have Postman APP. 

Postman is an application used for API testing. It is an HTTP client that tests HTTP requests,
utilizing a graphical user interface, through which we obtain different types of responses that need to be subsequently validated.


In this homework I have used www.demoblaze.com and performed tests on it.
